                    <input type="radio" name="q2" value="onlyprojects">A government should only tax to fund projects as using the fruits of your labour for redistribution is akin to slavery<BR>

                    <input type="radio" name="q3" value="monetarist">Governments should use monetary policy instead of fiscal policy, to protect private investment<br>
                    <input type="radio" name="q3" value="austrian">No to both, fiscal policy crowds out private investment, and monetary policy creates business cycles<br>
